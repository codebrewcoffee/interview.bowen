          I am currently between jobs. I've recently returned to the United States after living in

          4. How familiar are you with GitHub? Have you ever spoken with a
          recruiter or hiring team at GitHub? If so, how recently?
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-4">
          As a full-stack developer, I'm highly familiar with GitHub and use it extensively for version control, collaboration, and project deployment. I manage all my personal and team projects on GitHub, from repositories to GitHub Pages for front-end hosting. I regularly work with Git, pushing code, managing branches, handling pull requests, and contributing to open-source projects.

Regarding interactions with GitHub recruiters or hiring teams, I have not yet had the opportunity to speak with them directly. However, I continuously follow updates from GitHub, staying informed on new features and improvements to enhance my workflows.

          5. Give me a brief overview of your work experience and
          responsibilities starting with your most recent role.
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-5">
          In addition to constantly adding new projects to my portfolio, I’m currently wrapping up a freelance project for a local catering company, where I developed a web service to enhance their online ordering and customer management systems. The prototype can be found on my <a href="https://codebrewcoffee.github.io/jordan.portfolio.github.io/" target="_blank">portfolio site</a>! Alongside this, I’m collaborating with a more senior developer as we assemble a team to build a web service that transmits G.I.S. data. We’re actively adjusting the scope of the project as we move forward, ensuring the solution aligns with both client needs and technical requirements. This blend of freelance and collaborative teamwork allows me to continually refine my development skills.

          maintaining production software in languages including, but not

        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-6">Yes, I have over 2 years of experience as a full-stack developer, with proven expertise in maintaining production software, particularly in JavaScript. I've built and deployed multiple full-stack applications from scratch, including web services using technologies such as React, Node.js, and Express. I also have experience working with SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as REST APIs. In addition to my professional experience, I’ve been continuously expanding my knowledge through freelance projects, where I’ve developed web services for various clients, including a local catering company and a GIS data transmission service in collaboration with a senior developer. My practical experience is equivalent to having formal education in a related technical field.</p>
