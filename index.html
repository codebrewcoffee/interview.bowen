          1. What are your biggest strengths?
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-1">
          My biggest strength is my ability to adapt and adjust. I’ve spent the
          past few years living and working in Tokyo, Japan! I’ve grown
          accustomed to the work ethic that comes along with assimilating into
          the culture.

          2. What is your greatest weakness?
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-2">
          My greatest weakness would be my habit of taking thorough and
          efficient notes on things I’m learning. It can be a bit time consuming
          in the wrong circumstances.

          3. What skills make you stand out for the PA position?
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-3">
          I spend my days building web applications and studying computer
          science. I have a high attention to detail and can learn anything if I
          spend enough time on it. Plus, I’m already a bit of an assistant to my
          father. I’m assisting him with his own correspondence as I type this.

          4. Do you have any experience in PA role or similar dispensation?
        </p>
        <p class="answer" id="answer-4">
          I do not. But I believe my background in teaching and computer science
          have taught me to be both flexible and disciplined. And I feel these
          two traits would carry over quite nicely to a PA role.
